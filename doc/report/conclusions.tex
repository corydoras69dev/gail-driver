As a result of this experiment, it seems that GAIL has the possibility to generate accurate imitation policy from a lot of expert data. The paper argued that GRU was superior to MLP, but the results did not show much difference.
Experiments performed with the authors' generated training data showed that the GRU produced a slightly higher generator. In the learned policies, some items had good GRU results, but the off-road rate was quite poor.
