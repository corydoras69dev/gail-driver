{\tt rllab} comes with support for running reinforcement learning experiments on an EC2 cluster, and tools for visualizing the results. See the documentation for details.

The main modules use {\tt Theano} as the underlying framework, and we have support for {\tt TensorFlow} under {\tt sandbox/rocky/tf}.


\section{Software structure summary}

The program is roughly divided into a training program consisting of Python and Julia and a validation program consisting only of Julia.



\subsection{Training program summary}

All vehicle behavior is described by the Julia program. The discriminator network is implemented in Python's {\tt Tensorflow}.
policy network is a {\tt ForwardNets} module by Julia, but uses python's {\tt Tensorflow} to configure the network.


{\tt train\_gail\_model.py} is the main program of the task. (see Figure.\ref{fig:training_launch})
However, this program often stops at a segmentation fault. It is speculated that the cause lies in the interface between Python and Julia's code, but it is not known for certain.
Meta launch program {\tt train\_launcher.py} continues the calculation by using snapshot when {\tt train\_gail\_model.py} terminates improperly.




\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=16cm]{./figures/training_launch_program.png}
\caption{launch program}
\label{fig:training_launch}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

In the {\tt train\_gail\_model.py} code. (see Figure\ref{fig:training_main})
Policy networks (MLP and GRU) are generated from the line 274 to the line 294, 
by using {\tt GaussianMLPPolicy()} and {\tt GaussianGRUPolicy()}.

Reward network(for GAIL discriminator) is generated from the line 337 to the line 331, by using {\tt RewardMLP()}.




\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=14cm]{./figures/training_main_program.png}
\caption{main program}
\label{fig:training_main}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Main loop of this task is the function {\tt train()} at the end line of {\tt train\_gail\_model.py}.
Implementation of this function is in the code {\tt batch\_polopt.py}.

\caption{batch program}
\label{fig:training_batch}
\end{center}
\end{figure}








\subsection{Validation program summary}

All vehicle behavior is described by the Julia program. 
Policy is also written in Julia.
The validation program does not update Policy. It also doesn't use the discriminator, so it doesn't use Python code.

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=14cm]{./figures/validation_main.png}
\caption{validation main}
\label{fig:validationa_main}
\end{center}
\end{figure}


\section{Features for observation}

This is all the data that the vehicle observes while driving. The data consists of the relative position of another vehicle seen from the own vehicle around the vehicle as a reflection of virtual LiDAR, odometry, and other indicators.

Observation includes 51 elements of scalars.

\begin{itemize}
\item 20 directions of Lidar beam range $[m]$
\item 20 directions of Lidar beam range rate $[m/s]$

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=10cm]{./figures/lidar_beam.png}
\caption{20 lidar beams(range and range-rate)}
\label{fig:lidar_beam}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Range is the distance to another vehicle observed in the LiDAR beam direction.
The range rate is the velocity (in the beam direction) of another vehicle observed in the LiDAR beam direction.

\item speed of ego vehicle. $[m/s]$

Speed is a scalar value, longitudinal speed to the lane direction.

\item vehicle length $[m]$

Bounding box size of vehicle heading direction.

\item vehicle width $[m]$

Bounding box size of vehicle perpendicular heading direction.

\item lane offset $[m]$

Lateral distance from lane center.

\item lane relative heading $[rad]$
\item lane curvature $[m^{-1}]$
\item marker distance (L) $[m]$

Distance to the left edge of the road.

\item marker distance (R) $[m]$

Distance to the right edge of the road.

\item 3 indicators in ${0, 1}$ value for undesirable  states.
\end{itemize}

3 indicators are used to identify when the ego vehicle encountered undesirable states, such as collision, offroad and reverse.
If there are undesirable states, the correspondent  indicator shows 1 otherwise 0.





\subsection{Input/output of policies}

Policy's inputs are 51 elements as observation.

Policies outputs are 2 elements as action.
Action is as follows.

\begin{itemize}
\item acceleration $[m/s^2]$
\item turn rate $[rad/s]$
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Input/output for discriminator}

Discriminator's input is a 51 element vector as an observation and an action. (total 53 elements)

Discriminator's output is a bit. "1" means it is an expert policy.





\section{Reward network summary}

Reward network is a discriminator and is realized by tensorflow. The surrogate reward is calculated based on the discrimination result by this network.

\section{Summary of environment}

To support the development of algorithms for driver behavior at microscopic levels, the Next Generation SIMulation ({\it NGSIM}) computer program is collecting detailed, high-quality traffic datasets. {\it NGSIM} stakeholder groups identified the collection of real-world vehicle trajectory data as important to understanding and researching driver behavior at microscopic levels. The {\it NGSIM} datasets represent the most detailed and accurate field data collected to date for traffic microsimulation research and development. 





Dataset for this experiment is as follows.


\subsection{Interstate 80 Freeway Dataset(Publication Number: FHWA-HRT-06-137)}

The Interstate 80 (I-80) freeway dataset was the first of several datasets collected under the {\it NGSIM} program.

Researchers for the {\it NGSIM} program collected detailed vehicle trajectory data on eastbound I-80 in the San Francisco Bay area in Emeryville, CA, on April 13, 2005. The study area was approximately 500 meters (1,640 feet) in length and consisted of six freeway lanes, including a high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lane. An onramp also was located within the study area. Seven synchronized digital video cameras, mounted from the top of a 30-story building adjacent to the freeway, recorded vehicles passing through the study area. NG-VIDEO, a customized software application developed for the {\it NGSIM} program, transcribed the vehicle trajectory data from the video. This vehicle trajectory data provided the precise location of each vehicle within the study area every one-tenth of a second, resulting in detailed lane positions and locations relative to other vehicles. 

A total of 45 minutes of data are available in the full dataset, segmented into three 15-minute periods: 4:00 p.m. to 4:15 p.m.; 5:00 p.m. to 5:15 p.m.; and 5:15 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. These periods represent the buildup of congestion, or the transition between uncongested and congested conditions, and full congestion during the peak period. In addition to the vehicle trajectory data, the I-80 dataset also contains computer-aided design and geographic information system files, aerial orthorectified photos, freeway loop detector data within and surrounding the study area, raw and processed video, signal timing settings on adjacent arterial roads, traffic sign information and locations, weather data, and aggregate data analysis reports.

The full I-80 dataset is freely available at the {\it NGSIM} Web site at \url{http://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/trafficanalysistools/ngsim.htm}.

\subsection{US Highway 101 Dataset(Publication Number: FHWA-HRT-07-030)}

The US Highway 101 (US 101) dataset was one of several datasets collected under the NGSIM program.
Description

Researchers for the {\it NGSIM} program collected detailed vehicle trajectory data on southbound US 101, also known as the Hollywood Freeway, in Los Angeles, CA, on June 15th, 2005. The study area was approximately 640 meters (2,100 feet) in length and consisted of five mainline lanes throughout the section. An auxiliary lane is present through a portion of the corridor between the on-ramp at Ventura Boulevard and the off-ramp at Cahuenga Boulevard. Eight synchronized digital video cameras, mounted from the top of a 36-story building adjacent to the freeway, recorded vehicles passing through the study area. NG-VIDEO, a customized software application developed for the {\it NGSIM} program, transcribed the vehicle trajectory data from the video. This vehicle trajectory data provided the precise location of each vehicle within the study area every one-tenth of a second, resulting in detailed lane positions and locations relative to other vehicles.

A total of 45 minutes of data are available in the full dataset, segmented into three 15 minute periods: 7:50 a.m. to 8:05 a.m.; 8:05 a.m. to 8:20 a.m.; and 8:20 a.m. to 8:35 a.m.

These periods represent the buildup of congestion, or the transition between uncongested and congested conditions, and full congestion during the peak period. In addition to the vehicle trajectory data, the US 101 dataset also contains computer-aided design and geographic information system files, aerial ortho-rectified photos, loop detector data, raw and processed video, weather data, and aggregate data analysis reports.

The full US 101 dataset is freely available at the {\it NGSIM} Web site at \url{http://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/trafficanalysistools/ngsim.htm}.

Travelers in freeway merge areas face complex tasks in executing their short term trip plans. They must accelerate to the predominant through speeds, check for acceptable gaps, and position themselves for their next maneuvers. During medium and heavy congestion, these tasks are complicated by the volume of other travelers competing for space on crowded freeways.

In reality, travelers often overcome some of this complexity by cooperating with other drivers. Existing microsimulation models generally use basic or modified versions of lane changing models to model freeway merging behaviors. While these models do account for gaps created by adjacent vehicles, and in some cases model reduced gap acceptance thresholds during congested conditions, the models do not explicitly account for cooperation among drivers. As a result, existing models tend to overpredict congestion because the models fail to capture localized system optimization that occurs when drivers exhibit cooperative behaviors.

{\it NGSIM} researchers used the US 101 dataset to develop and validate a new driver behavior model, the Cooperative/Forced Freeway Merge model, which models lane changing on a freeway merge and weaving section that treats driver cooperation explicitly.

\section{Changes to the original program}


List of the original program and the changes will be inserted.


\subsection{Julia version problem}

Original program is based on Julia 0.5. 
Since JULIA that can be used in this experiment is limited to version 0.6 or later, grammatical corrections were made.

\subsubsection{AbstructType definition}

Old style definition is as follows.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Julia old style definition ,label=list:julia_05_def, escapechar=!, language=Pascal, frame=single]
abstract UserType                          # definition of abstract type
a = Array(ArrayElement, size)              # definition of array
\end{lstlisting}



\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Julia 0.6 style ,label=list:julia_06_def, escapechar=!, language=Pascal, frame=single]
abstract type UserType end                 # definition of abstract type
a = Array{ArrayElement}(size)              # definition of array
\end{lstlisting}


\subsubsection{ForwardNets.jl/variable.jl}

Old style definition is as follows.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Original code 
,label=list:julia_05_forwardnets, language=Pascal, frame=single]
function Base.push!{T}(net::ForwardNet{T}, ::Type{Variable},
    name::Symbol,
    shape::Int...
    )

    push!(net, Variable(name, Array(T, shape...)))
end
function Base.push!{T}(net::ForwardNet{T}, ::Type{Variable},
    name::Symbol,
    parent::NameOrIndex,
    )

    node = Variable(name, output(net[parent]))
    push!(net, node, parent)
end
\end{lstlisting}

Each push function is defined twice, but it is an error because the argument is ambiguous. Avoiding the ambiguity by giving an extra dummy argument to the second function.
Changed code is as follows.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Changed code 
,label=list:julia_06_forwardnets, language=Pascal, frame=single]
function Base.push!{T}(net::ForwardNet{T}, ::Type{Variable},
    name::Symbol,
    shape::Int...
    )

    push!(net, Variable(name, Array{T}(shape...)))
end
function Base.push!{T}(net::ForwardNet{T}, ::Type{Variable},
    name::Symbol,
    parent::NameOrIndex,
    ::Symbol      # dummy symbol inserted
    )

    node = Variable(name, output(net[parent]))
    push!(net, node, parent)
end
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{AutomotiveDrivingModels.jl/src/util/minkowski.jl}

This program is a part of the program that finds collision of two convex figures by minkovski sum.
The edge set has an array of edges and a variable indicating the size of the array inside. 
This class has the internal size and external size of an array separately, and is intended to prevent the array resizing from being heavily used.
However, program authors confused the external and internal sizes of arrays in important places.

Following function {\tt get\_sdge()} is a function for extracting an edge from a certain class defined to resemble an array of two-dimensional vectors.

Old style definition is as follows.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Original code 
,label=list:julia_05_automotive, escapechar=!, language=Pascal, frame=single]
function get_edge(pts::Array{VecE2,1}, i::Int, npts::Int=length(pts))
    a = pts[i]
    b = i+1 !$\leq$! npts ? pts[i+1] : pts[1]
    LineSegment(a,b)
end

:

# caller of the get_edge
        seg = get_edge(poly.pts, i)

\end{lstlisting}

In fact, an array with an internal size of 8 and an external size of 4 was sorted, and un-initialized values and correct values were mixed and sorted.

This default argument {\tt npts::Int=length(pts)} was misprocessed later because it initialized the external size {\tt npts} with the internal size {\tt length(pts)}.



\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Changed code 
,label=list:julia_06_automotive, escapechar=!, language=Pascal, frame=single]
function get_edge(pts::Array{VecE2,1}, i::Int, npts::Int)  
    a = pts[i]
    b = i+1 !$\leq$! npts ? pts[i+1] : pts[1]
    LineSegment(a,b)
end

:

# caller of the get_edge.  Specify the external size explicitly.
        seg = get_edge(poly.pts, i, poly.npts)  

\end{lstlisting}


\subsubsection{Vec.jl/src/Vec.jl}

The specified version of Vec.jl does not define some of the functions used. Added the following definitions.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Added code 
,label=list:julia_06_vec, escapechar=!, language=Pascal, frame=single]
Vec.abs2(a::VecE2) = a.x * a.x + a.y * a.y
Vec.abs2(a::VecSE2) = a.x * a.x + a.y * a.y
Vec.abs(a::VecE2) = sqrt(a.x * a.x + a.y * a.y)
Vec.abs(a::VecSE2) = sqrt(a.x * a.x + a.y * a.y)
\end{lstlisting}


\subsubsection{julia/validation/validation.jl}

This if statement determines whether the net object of model is of GRU type or MLP type. The net object is a policy, and MLP or GRU neural networks are registered. If it is of GRU type, it is intended to initialize the recurrent layer.

However, there is a misunderstanding of grammar. The {\tt fieldnames()} function is a function to check the member of the instance, and does not check the layers registered in {\tt net}.
Therefore, this if statement never holds.


\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Original code 
,label=list:julia_06_vec, escapechar=!, language=Pascal, frame=single]
    if Symbol("gru") in fieldnames(model.net)
        model.net[:gru].h_prev = zeros(length(model.net[:gru].h_prev))
    end
\end{lstlisting}

The unmodified code is designed not to initialize the GRU type recurrent layer.
After introducing a new variable called {\tt gru\_type}, the GRU type recurrent layer is always initialized.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Changed code 
,label=list:julia_06_vec, escapechar=!, language=Pascal, frame=single]
    if gru_type
        model.net[:gru].h_prev = zeros(length(model.net[:gru].h_prev))
    end
\end{lstlisting}
